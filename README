wowproxy is a transparent SOCKS-proxy that I wrote to be able to tunnel WoW through an SSH-tunnel for playing on the Rebirth. In its current state the program seems to work, but it is very much an early version.

Feel free to use this code as you see fit for whatever you like. I take no responsibility for what you do with it.
